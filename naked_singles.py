        Every Sudoku puzzle will have cells that have only one possible candidate.
        If there arenâ€™t any other candidates showing, Sudoku players call this a naked single.

        Every naked single allows us to safely eliminate that number from all other cells in the
        row, column, and region that the naked single lies in.
        The logic is simple. If there is one cell that contains a single candidate,
        then that candidate is the solution for that cell.
        See link above for example.
